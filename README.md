Interactomics studies play a critical role in elucidating protein structures, functions, and interactions within complex cellular environments. Cross-linking mass spectrometry with cleavable cross-linking reagents (cXL-MS) has emerged as a powerful technique for large-scale interactomics analysis by identifying proximal amino acid pairs in protein samples. However, current computational cXL-MS tools face limitations in proteomic-scale studies, such as being too slow or generating excessive false positives, particularly at the protein-protein interactions level (PPIs). 

Here, we present **Scout**, a computational methodology that enables interactomic analysis by identifying mass spectra of peptides linked with cleavable cross-linking reagents. By leveraging machine learning techniques, Scout ensures a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) at multiple levels, including cross-linked spectrum matches, residue pairs, and PPIs. Our methodology offers an efficient and accurate solution for large-scale interactomics studies, addressing the existing computational challenges.
